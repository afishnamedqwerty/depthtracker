# MoE NSA Transformer Depth Heatmap and Visual Object Tracking

## Overview
This repository implements a cutting-edge multi-modal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformer architecture designed for two primary tasks: predicting depth heatmaps and performing visual object tracking using multi-input video feeds. The project integrates innovative techniques such as native sparse attention mechanisms and motion modeling with Kalman filters, drawing insights from the Samurai paper.

## Architecture Design
Multi-modal MoE Transformer:

Combines multiple expert networks to handle diverse tasks efficiently.
Designed for scalability and performance in multi-input scenarios.


### Depth Heatmap Prediction:

Predicts depth information represented as heatmaps, crucial for spatial understanding in applications like robotics and autonomous vehicles.

### Visual Object Tracking (VOT):

Tracks objects across video sequences using advanced motion modeling techniques.
Incorporates Kalman filters to enhance tracking accuracy and reliability.

### Sparse Attention Mechanisms:

Employs native sparse attention (NSA) for efficient computation, reducing unnecessary calculations while maintaining model performance.
Optimized for modern GPU architectures with hardware-aligned processing.

### Hardware-Aligned Design:

Block-wise processing and memory access patterns optimized for Tensor Core utilization on GPUs like the A100, ensuring high computational efficiency.

### Dynamic Hierarchical Sparsity:

Combines coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to reduce computational load while preserving important context.

### Training-Aware Design:

Ensures compatibility with end-to-end training processes, maintaining stability and performance without sacrificing model capabilities.
